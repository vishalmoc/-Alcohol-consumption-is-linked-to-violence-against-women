Key Findings
ðŸ”´ 1. Alcohol Consumption is Strongly Linked to Domestic Violence
More men consuming alcohol â†’ Higher domestic violence cases
Spousal Violence (%) and Physical Violence During Pregnancy (%) are the strongest predictors
ðŸŸ¡ 2. Some Factors Were Not Useful for Prediction
Sexual Violence (%) and Womenâ€™s Bank Account (%) did NOT strongly impact menâ€™s alcohol use
Female Education (%) was dropped due to high correlation
ðŸŸ¢ 3. Best Model for Prediction
Model	Accuracy	Insights Provided
Linear Regression	Good	Best for understanding statistical significance
Decision Tree	Average	Can capture non-linearity but may overfit
Random Forest	Best	Most accurate predictions, avoids overfitting
Conclusion & Recommendations
âœ… Alcohol Control Policies Can Help Reduce Domestic Violence
Awareness programs and alcohol restrictions may lower violence
Support for pregnant women is crucial (as physical violence during pregnancy is a key risk factor)
âœ… Financial & Educational Empowerment Alone Wonâ€™t Solve the Issue
Womenâ€™s financial independence (bank accounts) did NOT directly impact alcohol-related violence
Education is important, but its effect on alcohol-related violence is indirect
